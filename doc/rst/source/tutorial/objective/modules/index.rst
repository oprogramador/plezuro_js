Modules
=======

Modules are in the same time classes and namespaces. You can use a module to create an object,
you can use in statically (like static fields and methods in Java) and you can assign other
modules as static fields creating namespaces. Of course you can create multiple classes in the
same source file, however it is recommended to write exactly one module in one file.
