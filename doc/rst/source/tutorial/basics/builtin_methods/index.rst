Built-in methods
================

In further reading you will take some knowledge of modules and methods in Plezuro.
However at this moment you should know how the method works. Basically it is like
a function calling. Zero argument (called this object) is accessible via the keyword
'this'. Like in the function you can also use such keywords 'first', 'second', 'third',
'args'. Calling a method, at the first you write the zero argument (this object), than
the dot ``.``, function name, bracket opening ``(``, arguments separated by the comma
``,`` and the bracket closing ``)``. However with no arguments the bracket is not
required.
