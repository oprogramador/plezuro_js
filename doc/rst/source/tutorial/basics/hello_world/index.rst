Hello world
===========

'Hello world' in computing means the simpler application in a specific
programming language. It shows generally how a language looks.

There are several ways in Plezuro to write it. It is a scripting language so
there is required no main function nor class. The simpler script just returns a
value. You can also use the 'dumpl' method for printing to a buffer (in most
cases the console).
