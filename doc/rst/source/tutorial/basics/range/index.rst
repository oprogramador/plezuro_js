Range
=====

To simple iteration over numbers in an arithmetic sequence, Plezuro provides
a useful tool which is the range. To create a range, you use the ``..``
operator. So you can write the begin number, ``..`` and the end number or
eventually the begin number, ``..``, the step number, ``..`` and the end number.

It exists ``each`` method which iterates the range. In the inner function
the zero argument is the index (natural number starting from 0) and the first
argument is a number from the range.
