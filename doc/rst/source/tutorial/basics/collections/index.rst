Collections
===========

One of the indespensable features of a programming language are the collections.
Of course, Plezuro provides some sorts of it. The most basic one is the list.
It can contain objects of different types (like list in Python, Ruby, Javascript
or PHP as well List<Object> in Java or List<object> in câ™¯). It implies that a list
can also contain other lists. Moreover a list can contain a self-reference (it
means one of its elements is a pointer to this list) because the lists are passed
by reference to functions and to collections.
