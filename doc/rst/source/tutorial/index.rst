Tutorial
============

This is tutorial of Plezuro programming language.

===============
For whom is it?
===============

If you are a programmer who just knows another programming language (ex. c,
Java, Python...), this tutorial bring you the knowledge necessary to create
applications in Plezuro. Nonetheless the experience is what is the most
important in programming technologies. So just try to write more and more in
Plezuro.

If you are new to programming, this tutorial should be readable for you
because it explaines how the stuff works but if you do not understand it maybe
you should learn first basics of Javascript (it is the most related to Plezuro)
or eventually another programming language.


======================
Other useful materials
======================

If you want to learn more, you can read the specification of Plezuro. It is
written in a not complicated manner. This is just a view from another site. You
can read Plezuro scripts on Github and try to write something similar.
