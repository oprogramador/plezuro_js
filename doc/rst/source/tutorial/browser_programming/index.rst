Web browser programming
=======================

As you just know, Plezuro is compiled to Javascript. So we can write
applications runned in the web browser (client-side web apps).

To be able to develop web apps in Plezuro, you should know HTML and CSS (at
least the basics).
You can read it from the following tutorials:
