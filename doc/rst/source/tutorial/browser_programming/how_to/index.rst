How to
======

Contrary to Javascript, Plezuro cannot be embedded to HTML. It is not a missing
feature, rather a way to maintain a readable code. So you must include a
Javascript generated from Plezuro source in an HTML file. Moreover you must
include the plezuro.js library.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../../../src/plezuro/doc/web/basic/index.html
  :language: html
  :caption: basic/index.html

basic/main.plez
include_vim(../../../plezuro_html/doc/web/basic/main.plez)
