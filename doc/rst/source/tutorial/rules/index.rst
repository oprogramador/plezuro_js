Basic rules
===========

Plezuro is an imperative, object-oriented, functional, procedural and reflective programming language.

The main ideas are:

#. The code should be possibly short (as long as it is human readable).

#. Very simple syntax.

#. The code should be easy to read for a beginner programmer.

#. The power of the language should be based on the standard library, not its syntax.

#. Explicit is always better than implicit.

#. Everything is a variable.

#. Everything is an object.

#. Multiple inheritance.

#. There is no difference between a module, a class and a namespace.

#. No annotations and other additional syntax - everything is based on the basic syntax of the language.
