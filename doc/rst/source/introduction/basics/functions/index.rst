Functions
=========

To write a function, you use just the curlies ('{', '}'). Everything in a curly bracket is a function.
It includes also conditions and loops. The zero argument is accessible via the keyword 'this' and
the next ones 'first', 'second' and 'third'. You have also access to the array of the arguments
using the keyword 'args'.
