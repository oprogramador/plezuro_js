Tools
=====

The basic tool is the Java 1.8. However in the future it is scheduled a
compiler implemented in Plezuro.

To fully utilize the source of Plezuro, you need:

#. JRE 1.8
#. JDK 1.8
#. A Unix-like operating system.
#. Realpath
#. Node.js
#. Nesh

In not Unix-like systems the Plezuro development is still possible, although you
have to rewrite the automating scripts.
