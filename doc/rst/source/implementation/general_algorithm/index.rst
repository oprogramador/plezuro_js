General algorithm
=================

We can specify the main parts of the algorithm:

#. Compiling
    #. Reading the script.
    #. Checking if the script is not empty (otherwise it return null).
    #. Division of the code into the lines.
    #. Tokenization:

       * lines are divided into tokens
       * except of multiline tokens which can expand to multiple lines
    #. Eventual changing of token types (ex. from basic ones to its subtokens).
    #. Validation - detecting of syntax errors by the tokens order.
    #. Converting of Plezuro tokens into the output language tokens.
    #. Writing output to the file.
#. Binding output language (currenty Javascript) libraries
