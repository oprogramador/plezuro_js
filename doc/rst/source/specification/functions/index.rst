Functions
=========

A function is a set of operations that can be executed in any moment at the
runtime. A function takes any number of arguments which are accessible with the
following keywords:

* this - zero argument
* first - first argument
* second - second argument
* third - third argument
* args - the list of the arguments

In case of an inner function the arguments of the outer one are hidden by those
of the inner one.

Each function returns a value. The type is not specified. They are two ways to
return a value:

* explicitly - with the ``return`` keyword
* implicitly - the last expression is returned


=======
Methods
=======

A method works in the same way as a function. The only difference is the object
(variable before the dot sign is passed as a zero argument and the next
arguments are numbered from 1. In method calling when there is no arguments
(except for this object) the bracket after method name is not required.


=======
Scripts
=======

Even the scripts behave in the same manner as a function. They take arguments
(the access in the same way) and they return a value.
