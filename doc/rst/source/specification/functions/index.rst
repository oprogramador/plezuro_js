Functions
=========

A function is a set of operations that can be executed in any moment at the
runtime. A function takes any number of arguments which are accessible with the
following keywords:

* this - zero argument
* first - first argument
* second - second argument
* third - third argument
* args - the list of the arguments

Each function returns a value. The type is not specified. They are two ways to
return a value:

* explicitly - with the ``return`` keyword
* implicitly - the last expression is returned
