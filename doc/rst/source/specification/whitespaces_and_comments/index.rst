Whitespaces and comments
========================

The comments behave like they were replaced by a single space. So the code
inside is not executed. Neither are the whitespaces executed.
Though they have a little impact on the code: it is
impossible to insert a comment (nor a whitespace) inside the symbol (variable) name; the only
possibility is to insert comments between multiple tokens.
