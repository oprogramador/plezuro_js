Expressions
===========

An expression is a single command separated with the ``;`` operator. Although it
can be multiple instructions (ex. ``x = y = 2 + 4``). What does it mean exactly?
From the Plezuro's point of view the expression is an atomic instuction but from
the CPU's (even purely theoretical CPU)
point of view one expression can contain multiple instructions.
