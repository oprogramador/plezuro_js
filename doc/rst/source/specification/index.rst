Specification
=============

This is the formal specification of the Plezuro programming language. The
purpose is to define the rules that have to be implemented in any version of the
language.

**For whom is it?**

This is for developpers who would like to implement other version of Plezuro, a
library, an extension as well to standard users who want to improve their
knowledge. The tutorial is more for learning and simple understanding but
the specification is more for knowing exactly how Plezuro applications should
behave and therefore how compilers and interpreters should behave.

Nonetheless the code is the best way to define exactly the behavior. So each
version of Plezuro must match all the automatic tests included in the mainstream
implementation.
