    * "~"
    * "=>"

* A single-argument operator (the operator at the right)
  is one of the following:

    * "++"	
    * "--"

* A double-argument operator (the zero argument, the operator, the first argument;
  from the evaluated at the end to the evaluated at the begin)
  is one of the following:

    * ";"
    * ","
    * ":="
    * "="
    * "+="
    * "-="
    * "\*="
    * "/="
    * "^="
    * "&="
    * "\|="
    * "%="
    * ".="
    * "~~"
    * "<->"
    * "<<"
    * ">>"	
    * "?"	
    * "|"	
    * "&"	
    * "<=>"	
    * ">="
