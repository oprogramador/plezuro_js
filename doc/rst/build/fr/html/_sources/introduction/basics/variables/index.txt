Variables
=========

Before we can use any variable, we have to declare it. It is pretty simple, just write the name of the variable and the dollar sign ('$') immediately before it.
In next occurrences of a variable, you should write it without the dollar sign.

In Plezuro there is dynamic typing like in other dynamic languages such as Python, Ruby or Javascript. Also everything is a variable (including functions and modules).
